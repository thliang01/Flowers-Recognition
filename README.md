# Flowers-Recognition


## Introduction

In this project we are going to analyze the data given and build a classification model to recognition different flower:

* Recognize the flower in machine learning model
* deploy machine learning model using Streamlit(Gradio), Flask, Docker


This project is done as a part of [Project of the Week at DataTalks.Club](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week/blob/main/2022-08-14-frontend.md)

Dataset:[Flowers Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)

## The data

The data is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)


**Context**

This dataset contains 4242 images of flowers.

The data collection is based on the data flicr, google images, yandex images.

You can use this datastet to recognize plants from the photo.

**Content**

The pictures are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion.

For each class there are about 800 photos. Photos are not high resolution, about 320x240 pixels. Photos are not reduced to a single size, they have different proportions!

## Technologies

* fastai
* wandb
* Flask/FastAPI
* Docker
* Streamlit/Gradio

## Day 1

* Choose Flowers-Recognition for this projects
* Select the dataset from kaggle [Flowers Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)
* Create a github repository
* Create basic Web App on [Huggingface Spaces](huggingface.co/spaces)
* Share your progress in Slack and in social media

## Day 2

* Perform data cleaning for your data in a jupyter notebook
* And try out various models for your data in notebook
* Add a [Training-report](https://wandb.ai/thliang01/Flowers%20Recognition/reports/Flowers-Recognition-Classify-Baseline--VmlldzoyNDY1NTY3?accessToken=mt3k3wrb2kr53ur6zqnxu0v5jxl4r7idwsy2essw9prfiokv04pum1ofagu327h0)
* Remove unfinished web app link
* Push your changes to github
* Share your progress in Slack and in social media

## TODO

* Try Hyperparameter Tuning
* Convert the notebook code into flask backend and test it using backend only
* Push your changes to github
* Share your progress in Slack and in social media
